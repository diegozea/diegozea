# Hi, I'm Diego Javier Zea 👋

🧬 I'm an **Associate Professor at Université Paris-Saclay**, working in **structural bioinformatics and molecular evolution**. My research focuses on understanding **proteins**, particularly how they evolve, move, interact, and function while considering complex aspects such as protein disorder and alternative splicing. To accomplish this, I perform diverse protein sequence and structural analysis, integrating **machine learning** and statistics as needed.

👨‍💻 I am a skilled **Python** and [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/) programmer passionate about making open-source bioinformatics tools. I am the leading developer and maintainer of:
-  🐉 [**MIToS**](https://github.com/diegozea/MIToS.jl): A package for protein sequence and structure analysis in the Julia programming language.
- ⚡ [**ThorAxe**](https://github.com/PhyloSofS-Team/thoraxe): A Python software to assess the evolutionary conservation of alternative splicing isoforms.

📒 I also wrote the book [**Interactive Visualization and Plotting with Julia**](https://a.co/d/cwLVepu) which shares methods and techniques for analyzing and visualizing data using the Julia language.
